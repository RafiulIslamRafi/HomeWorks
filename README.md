### Welcome to My HomeWorks
*  Currently I used HTML+CSS+Bootstrap for only index page. (It is also Responsive now.)
*  Solution font-end page: HTML + JavaScript (will upadate with CSS + BootStrap + another)
*  Solution Back-end page: by PHP (and also trying with python)
*  Backend is not working in Github (for back-end you can visit this link http://rafibd.epizy.com/ , but it is still backdated for my access problem)
