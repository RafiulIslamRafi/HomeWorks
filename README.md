# HomeWorks - (Mainly these homeWorks are given to us by Tushar sir of Our dept and I am trying to solve those)
### Welcome to My HomeWorks
*  Some question is given with a pdf from our teacher, I made a index page with those question.
*  I used HTML+CSS+Bootstrap for only index page. (It is also Responsive now.)
*  Solution font-end page: HTML + JavaScript (will upadate with CSS + BootStrap + another)
*  Solution Back-end page: by PHP (and also trying with python)
*  Backend is not working in Github (for back-end you can visit this link http://rafibd.epizy.com/ , but it is still backdated for my access problem)
*  visit this link https://rafiulislamrafi.github.io/HomeWorks/index.html to visit my webPage
*  Only those Back-end (with probabily font-end) will which status is ready in shown in index page
